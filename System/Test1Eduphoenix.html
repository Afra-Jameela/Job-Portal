The <b class="para">Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus)</b>, also known as the common peafowl, and blue peafowl, is a peafowl species native to the Indian subcontinent. It has been introduced to many other countries. Male peafowl are referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl are referred to as peahens, although both sexes are often referred to colloquially as a <b>peacock</b>

        There are several colour mutations of <b class="Indian">Indian peafowl</b>. These very rarely occur in the wild, but selective breeding has made them common in captivity.

        Peafowl are best known for the male's extravagant display feathers which, despite actually growing from their back, are thought of as a tail. The "train" is in reality made up of the enormously elongated upper tail coverts. The tail itself is brown and short as in the peahen. The colours result not from any green or blue pigments but from the micro-structure of the feathers and the resulting optical phenomena.
